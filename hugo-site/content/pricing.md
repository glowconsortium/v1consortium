    "questions": [
        {
            "question": "What counts as an 'asset' in my plan?",
            "answer": "An asset is any tracked vehicle or trailer in your fleet - including trucks, trailers, and truck-trailer combinations. Each individual piece of equipment counts as one asset regardless of type."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do AI tokens work?",
            "answer": "AI tokens are consumed when you use our intelligent features like predictive maintenance, route optimization, and load matching. Simple queries use 1-5 tokens, while complex analytics use 10-50 tokens. Most customers use 50-200 tokens per asset per month."
        },
        {
            "question": "What are secure environments?",
            "answer": "Secure environments provide isolated data spaces for different business units or customer segments. Each environment has separate user access, data storage, and compliance tracking - perfect for managing multiple business entities."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I change my plan as my fleet grows?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! You can upgrade your plan at any time. When you exceed your plan limits, we'll automatically suggest upgrades or you can purchase add-ons. Downgrades take effect at your next billing cycle."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do you offer annual billing discounts?",
            "answer": "Yes! Annual billing provides a 15% discount on all plans. Enterprise customers can also arrange custom billing terms including quarterly or multi-year agreements with additional savings."
        },

            "question": "What's included in the free trial?",
            "answer": "Our 14-day free trial includes full access to Professional plan features with up to 5 carriers, 25 assets, and 2,000 AI tokens. No credit card required to start, and we'll help you migrate your existing data."
